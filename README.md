## üö¶ State Management (Provider)

**Translate Now** leverages the **Provider** package to manage the application's state cleanly and efficiently. The `TranslationProvider` is at the core of the app's functionality:

* Manages the state of the source and target languages.
* Handles the translation logic, including API calls and error handling.
* Provides methods to add and remove translations from the favourites list.
* Ensures that UI components automatically update when a new translation is completed or a favourite is added.

## üíæ Local Data Storage (sqflite)

The **sqflite** plugin is employed for persistent local storage of the translation history and favourites. The `DatabaseHelper` class encapsulates all database interactions, including:

* Initialising and managing the SQLite database instance.
* Defining the schema for the `translation_history` and `favourites` tables.
* Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing translation records.
